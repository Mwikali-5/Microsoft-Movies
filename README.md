# Business Understanding
# Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They would want to venture into the movie creating business, only problem is they don't know what type of movies to create.

With the age of information, Microsoft can find out which movies are doing well in the box office and the highest grossing ones for smooth transition into the movie creating business.


# Solution
To aid Microsoft in this new business venture, I shall explore what types of films are currently doing well at the box office. I will analyze and translate the findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.


# Objectives
1. Identify what type of movies Microsoft should focus on in their new business venture.
2. Identify the turnover of movies and studios.
3. Identify if popular movies are the highest grossing movies.
4. Investigate the number of movies produced by a studio.

#Data Understanding
The data was downloaded from Moringa school's repository (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4).
The data sets available for this project were four files total, 'tmdb.movies.csv', 'bom.movie_gross.csv.gz', 'tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz' and 'rt.movie_info.tsv.gz'.
After going through this file, 'rt.movie_info.tsv.gz', there was no information that could assist in identifying what movie was being referred to and for that reason I did not use the file in my analysis.
This data was compiled over the period of 2010-2018

# Conclusion
a) The top grossing movies belong to superhero/action and animation category as shown in the top 10 highest grossing movies. Avengers:Infinity War a superhero movie is at the top, Avengers:Age of Ultron is 4th in the top 10 highest grossing, Black Panther at number 5 and Iron Man 3 at number 8.

Children Animation movies also feature in the top 10 highest grossing film with Frozen at number 7, Incredibles 2 at number 8.

b) Popularity of a movie does not translate to sales. Out of the top 10 most popular movies, only 3 featured in the top 10 highest grossing films and they were all superhero movies.

c) The number of movies a studio produces affects its overall revenue. The more movies a studio makes, the more it garners revenue as shown by the top 10 studios.
